##  What are containers?

* Developers use Virtual Machines (VM) to run their various environments in isolation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* VMs run inside a guest operating system, which runs on virtual hardware controlled by a hypervisor (Wmware, Virtualbox, HyperV, etc...) on top of the host OS. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Require a lot : memory, disk space and cpu power. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Hard to make change once the VM is set up. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Containers take a different approach: Leverage the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, providing the same features as VM but at the fraction of the computing power. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
