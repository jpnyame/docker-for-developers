##  What are containers?

* Developers use Virtual Machines (VM) to run their various environments in isolation
* VMs run inside a guest operating system, which runs on virtual hardware controlled by a hypervisor (Wmware, Virtualbox, HyperV, etc...) on top of the host OS.
* Require a lot : memory, disk space and cpu power.
* Hard to make change once the VM is set up.
* Containers take a different approach: Leverage the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, providing the same features as VM but at the fraction of the computing power.
